## Description

Our team was motivated to explore a hobby of one of our teammemebers and make a webpage focused on finding information on Pokemon and the Pokemon cards trading acrd game (TCG).
We wanted to give users easy access to information on the Pokemon they liked and further info on the physical collectable cards that went with them. 
Other sites may give you details on individual pokemon or on their cards but few if none do both in a single search funtion.

## Usage

 - Within the header find links to retailers and info about the Pokemon TCG
 - Select a current expansion from the dropdown menu and enter the name on any Pokemon (i.e. Bellsprout, Calyrex, Gengar, etc.)
    - the site will return information on that Pokemon and any cards from the selected expansion.
 - On Mobile if the Pokedex is closed, simply turn your phone to the wider screen size and it should open again.
 - See available card options listed in a row after a search.
    - each is a button that will show you that card's infomation if clicked on.
 - On page images are clickable and show you larger versions of the art or card clicked on.
 - Selecing the "market for" option on the card information pannel will take you to information on the pricing and avaialbility of purchasing that card individually from 
    https://www.cardmarket.com/en/Pokemon
